# Computer Vision Image Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements image classification using computer vision concepts from Chapter 24. The AI can recognize objects in images using a neural network trained with Google Teachable Machine. It supports classifying uploaded images through a Flask web interface and can also classify images using a webcam in real time.

## My Classification Task
- **Classes:** [List your 3–5 classes here, e.g., Pen, Phone, Mug, Book]
- **Training Images:** [Number of images per class, e.g., 60 per class]
- **Accuracy:** [Your test accuracy %, e.g., 92%]
